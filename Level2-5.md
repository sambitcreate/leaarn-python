# Comprehensive Python Programming Curriculum: Levels 2-5 (50 Courses Total)

## Level 2: Intermediate Python Foundations (10 Courses)

### Course 1: Advanced Data Structures - Tuples and Sets
**Extended Learning Content:**
Tuples are immutable sequences that provide data integrity and memory efficiency. Unlike lists, once created, tuples cannot be modified, making them ideal for storing configuration data, coordinates, or database records that shouldn't change accidentally. They support indexing, slicing, and iteration but not item assignment or deletion.

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements that automatically handle duplicates. They excel in membership testing (checking if an element exists) and mathematical set operations. Sets are mutable, allowing addition and removal of elements, but the elements themselves must be hashable (immutable).

**Advanced Applications:**
- Named tuples for creating lightweight data structures
- Frozen sets for immutable set operations
- Set comprehensions for efficient data filtering
- Performance comparisons between data structures

### Course 2: Dictionary Mastery and Advanced Techniques
**Extended Learning Content:**
Dictionaries are Python's implementation of hash tables, providing O(1) average-case lookup time. Modern Python (3.7+) maintains insertion order, combining the benefits of ordered containers with fast access.

Advanced dictionary techniques include nested dictionaries for complex data structures, dictionary comprehensions for concise creation, the collections.defaultdict for handling missing keys gracefully, and collections.Counter for frequency counting.

**Real-world Applications:**
- JSON-like data manipulation
- Configuration management
- Caching mechanisms
- Database result processing

### Course 3: String Processing and Text Manipulation
**Extended Learning Content:**
Strings in Python are immutable Unicode objects supporting extensive manipulation methods. String formatting has evolved from % formatting to .format() to f-strings, each offering different advantages for different use cases.

Regular expressions provide powerful pattern matching capabilities for complex text processing. The re module offers functions like search(), match(), findall(), and sub() for various pattern operations.

**Practical Skills:**
- Text cleaning and normalization
- CSV and log file parsing
- Email and phone number validation
- Template processing systems

### Course 4: Functions - Parameters and Return Values
**Extended Learning Content:**
Functions are first-class objects in Python, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. Understanding parameter types (positional, keyword, default, *args, **kwargs) enables flexible function design.

Variable scope follows the LEGB rule: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in. This hierarchy determines where Python looks for variable names and affects function behavior and memory usage.

**Advanced Concepts:**
- Higher-order functions
- Closures and their applications
- Function annotations and type hints
- Recursive function design patterns

### Course 5: Lambda Functions and Functional Programming
**Extended Learning Content:**
Lambda functions are anonymous functions perfect for short, single-expression operations. They're commonly used with built-in functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() to enable functional programming paradigms.

Functional programming emphasizes immutability, pure functions (no side effects), and function composition. This paradigm can lead to more predictable and testable code.

**Practical Applications:**
- Data transformation pipelines
- Event handling in GUIs
- Sorting with custom key functions
- API response processing

### Course 6: List and Dictionary Comprehensions
**Extended Learning Content:**
Comprehensions provide a concise way to create and transform data structures. They're often more readable and performant than equivalent loop constructs. List comprehensions can include conditions and nested iterations for complex data processing.

Dictionary and set comprehensions follow similar patterns, enabling efficient creation of these data structures from existing iterables or other dictionaries.

**Performance Benefits:**
- Memory efficiency compared to loops
- Faster execution for simple transformations
- Pythonic code style
- Nested comprehensions for complex data

### Course 7: Error Handling and Exception Management
**Extended Learning Content:**
Robust error handling distinguishes professional code from beginner scripts. Python's exception hierarchy allows catching specific errors while letting unexpected ones propagate. The try-except-else-finally construct provides complete control over error scenarios.

Custom exceptions enable domain-specific error reporting, improving debugging and user experience. Exception chaining with 'raise from' preserves error context in complex applications.

**Best Practices:**
- Specific exception handling vs. generic catches
- Logging vs. printing errors
- Error recovery strategies
- Exception performance considerations

### Course 8: File Operations and Path Handling
**Extended Learning Content:**
File I/O operations are fundamental for data persistence and processing. The pathlib module provides object-oriented path manipulation, replacing older os.path functions with more intuitive and cross-platform compatible methods.

Context managers (with statements) ensure proper resource cleanup, preventing file handle leaks and data corruption. Understanding binary vs. text modes is crucial for different file types.

**Real-world Scenarios:**

Object-oriented programming models real-world entities as objects containing data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Classes serve as blueprints defining object structure and capabilities.

The __init__ method initializes new instances, while self refers to the current instance within methods. Understanding instance vs. class attributes is crucial for proper object design.

**Design Principles:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Encapsulation for data protection
- Clear interface design
- Object lifecycle management

### Course 12: Inheritance and Method Overriding
**Extended Learning Content:**
Inheritance enables code reuse by creating specialized classes based on existing ones. Child classes inherit parent attributes and methods while adding or modifying functionality through method overriding.

Multiple inheritance allows inheriting from multiple parents, though it requires careful design to avoid conflicts. Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines which method gets called in inheritance hierarchies.

**Advanced Topics:**
- Abstract base classes

### Course 15: Polymorphism and Duck Typing
**Extended Learning Content:**
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably when they share common interfaces. Python's duck typing ("If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck") enables polymorphism without formal inheritance.

This flexibility allows writing generic code that works with any object implementing the required methods, promoting code reusability and flexibility.

**Design Patterns:**
- Strategy pattern implementation
- Template method pattern
- Interface segregation
- Composition over inheritance

### Course 16: Decorators - Function Enhancement

Decorators are functions that modify or enhance other functions without changing their source code. They implement the wrapper pattern, adding functionality like timing, logging, access control, or input validation.

Built-in decorators include @property for attribute access control, @staticmethod for utility methods, and @classmethod for alternative constructors.

**Decorator Applications:**
- Performance monitoring
- Access control and authentication
- Caching and memoization
- Input validation and type checking

### Course 17: Generators and Iterators
**Extended Learning Content:**
Generators provide memory-efficient ways to create sequences by producing values on-demand rather than storing them all in memory. The yield keyword creates generator functions that can be paused and resumed.

Iterator protocol defines how objects can be iterated over using __iter__ and __next__ methods. Understanding this protocol enables creating custom iterable objects.

**Memory Efficiency:**
- Processing large datasets
- Infinite sequences
- Pipeline processing
- Stream processing applications

### Course 18: Context Managers and the 'with' Statement
